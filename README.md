## Deployment

If you want to deploy your own instance of TikBot follow these instructions.

Firstly you need to generate a new bot token by following [Telegrams instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

This application has a publically accessible [Docker image](https://gitlab.com/fronbasal/tikbot/container_registry).

To deploy TikBot to your server you may use the provided `docker-compose.yml` configuration file.

Add your Telegram token to the `.env` file (or set it explicitly while runnning the bot) and boot it with `docker-compose`.
